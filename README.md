# Universal GMS Doze
Optimized GMS and disabled Find My Device with additional modified services

## Installation Guides
- Either install as a Magisk module or your choice root methods (in favor of SuperSU or losSU with Init.d Injector installed)
- Enforcing SELinux (optional)
- Compatible with doze/hibernator apps (optional)

## Troubleshooting
- **Find My Device** would be turning back **Enabled** while the **Play services library** getting updates. For everyone who already joined Beta Tester for Google Play services preferably to **opt-out** or **Leave** those beta programs which offered daily-routine-update. And if the update already passed (without your involvement) simply **Clear Data** for both Play services and Play Store (optional), **Reboot** your phone and give your **Best Patience** for wait then re-check.
- Providing **logs** is a suitable choice for reporting current **bugs**
- **Old changes** can be found in support thread
